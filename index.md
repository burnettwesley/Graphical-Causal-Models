# Graphical Causal Modeling

Material for the Burnett and Blackwell project that illustrates the use of graphical causal modeling, which is a visual representation of a researcher's qualitative assumptions for a particular empirical research project. Specifically, we use directed acyclic graphs as a framework to analyze cause-and-effect relationships.

## Manuscript Abstract

```markdown

This paper offers an accessible discussion of graphical models and causal
inference within empirical economics. More specifically, we examine the
use of graphical causal models and the relation to potential outcomes. A
graphical causal model is a visual representation of a researcher’s qualitative
causal assumptions. Economists have been slow to adopt such models
within applied research, but there is growing interest in using this framework
to analyze cause-and-effect relationships. We offer an overview of how to
use these graphical models for causal inference within economic research.
To demonstrate this procedure, we explore an example from the economics
literature using directed acyclic graphs to clearly delineate the model’s causal
assumptions. Finally, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of graphical
causal models.
